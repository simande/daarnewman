His understanding of the law and his draftmanship are outstanding and his ability to master all the evidence and make it available and comprehensible to the Court is remarkable. We have handled , in the past decade, a series of important commercial cases and I enjoyed every moment of our cooperation. In addition to being an ethical and helpful colleague of the bar, Jeffrey has great organizational skills which he has demonstrated in his participation in several educational and professional programs and legal associations.
